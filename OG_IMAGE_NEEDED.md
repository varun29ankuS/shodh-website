# OG Image Needed for SEO

## What is an OG Image?
The Open Graph (OG) image is what appears when you share your website link on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.).

## Required Specifications:
- **File name:** `og-image.png`
- **Location:** `public/og-image.png`
- **Dimensions:** 1200 x 630 pixels (required for social media)
- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **File size:** Under 1MB (for fast loading)

## What Should It Show?
Create an image that includes:
- **Shodh RAG logo**
- **Main headline:** "Production RAG on Your Laptop"
- **Key stats:**
  - "1000 docs on 16GB laptop"
  - "50-80ms queries"
  - "90% cost savings"
- **Brand colors:** Use the primary color (#ff6b35)

## Tools to Create It:
1. **Canva** (easiest) - https://canva.com
   - Search for "Open Graph Image" template
   - Customize with your text and logo

2. **Figma** (for designers)
   - Create 1200x630px frame
   - Design your image

3. **Online OG Image Generators:**
   - https://www.opengraph.xyz/
   - https://og-image.vercel.app/

## Quick Temporary Solution:
If you want to launch quickly, you can:
1. Use a simple text-based OG image generator
2. Or skip for now - the site will work without it (just won't look as good when shared)

## After Creating:
1. Save as `og-image.png`
2. Place in `public/` folder
3. The site will automatically use it (already configured in metadata)

**Priority:** Medium - Not required for launch, but important for social sharing.
